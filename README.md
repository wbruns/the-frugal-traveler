The app can be saved to your phone or laptop if you'd like to take it with you on your travels!  If you would like to install the code locally, you can clone the code from the GitHub repository at [the-frugal-traveler](https://github.com/wbruns/the-frugal-traveler).  After cloning the code you will need to install the required packages from the package.json file.

## **Usage**

The Frugal Traveler is designed to keep track of your budget.  You can post debit or expense transactions which get added to a graph display so you can stay on top of your finances!

Remember, you can save the webapp to your local device as well!
